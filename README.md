# Working repository for ongoing project

***A repo where a majority of the files are created by [Dwivedi et. al.](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns),*** as they have created a great platform to study GNNs from.
Aforementioned repository was downloaded in order to add and modify files.
